# Queue

**Definition**
A Queue is a linear data structure that stores elements in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. In a queue, the first element to be added will be the first to be removed.

**Operations**

* **Enqueue**: Add an item to the end of the queue.
* **Dequeue**: Remove the item from the front of the queue.
* **Peek**: View the item at the front without removing it.

**Usecases**
* Task Scheduling: For managing tasks in a way that they execute in the order they were added.
* **Breadth-First Search**: In graph algorithms like BFS.
* **Order Processing**: In e-commerce websites for order fulfillment.
* **Message Queues**: For asynchronous data processing.
* **Data Buffering**: In streaming services, to buffer data.
* **Operating Systems**: For process scheduling.

**Summary**
A Queue organizes data in a FIFO manner and is widely used in scenarios ranging from task scheduling to data buffering.
