# Array 

**Overview**
An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow for efficient random access and are commonly used in various programming languages.

**Characteristics**
* Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, set at the time of creation.
* Indexing: Elements can be accessed directly using an index.
* Contiguous Memory: Elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory.

**Operations**
* Access: O(1)
* Insertion/Deletion: O(n)
* Searcha : O(n)

**Use Cases**
* **Storing Data Temporarily**: For quick look-ups and temporary storage.
* **Homogeneous Collections**: Ideal for storing multiple items of the same type.
* **Random Access**: Useful in algorithms requiring fast, direct access to specific elements.
* **Memory Efficiency:** Better cache locality due to contiguous memory.
Low-Level Operations: Often used in lower-level code for performance optimization.

**Usage**
Arrays are used in sorting algorithms, storing data for other data structures, and implementing simple lookup tables, among other applications.

**Limitations**
Fixed size can lead to wasted space or the need for resizing.
Insertions and deletions are inefficient compared to other data structures like linked lists.
