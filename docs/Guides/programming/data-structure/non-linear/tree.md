# Tree

**Definition**
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It has a root node and zero or more child nodes. Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on.

**Characteristics**
* **Root**: The top node in a tree.
* **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
* **Leaf**: A node with no children.
* **Depth**: The level or distance from the root to a node.

**Types**
* **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
* **B-Tree:** Used in databases, each node can have more than two children.
* **Red-Black Tree:** A self-balancing binary search tree.
* **Trie:** Used in searching algorithms, each node stores a part of a string.
* **AVL Tree:** Another self-balancing binary search tree.
* **N-ary Tree:** Each node can have zero to N children.

**Usecases**
* **Hierarchical Data:** Representing organization structures, file systems.
* **Databases:** Indexing in databases (B-trees, Red-Black trees).
* **Graph Algorithms**: Trees serve as basis for algorithms like Primâ€™s and Kruskal's.
* **Searching:** Tries are used in text searching algorithms and autocorrect features.
* **Game Trees:** In AI for making decisions in games like chess.
* **DOM:** In web development for DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.

**Summary**
Trees are versatile data structures used in various applications from computer science to AI, databases, and web development.
