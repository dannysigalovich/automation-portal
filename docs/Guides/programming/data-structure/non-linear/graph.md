# Graph

**Definition**
A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting these nodes. Each edge connects two nodes and may have a weight or direction.

**Types**
* **Directed Graph:** Edges have direction.
* **Undirected Graph:** Edges have no direction.
* **Weighted Graph:** Edges have weights.
* **Unweighted Graph:** Edges have no weights.

**Operations**
* **Add Node:** Add a node to the graph.
* **Add Edge:** Add an edge between two nodes.
* **Remove Node**: Remove a node from the graph.
* **Remove Edge:** Remove an edge between two nodes.
* **Search:** Find a node or path, typically using algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.

**Use Cases**
* **Social Networks:** To represent connections between people.
* **Web Crawlers:** To model the structure of websites.
* **Routing Algorithms:** To find the shortest path in maps.
* **Dependency Trees:** In software systems or linguistics.
* **Recommendation Systems:** To suggest related products or content.

**Summary**
A graph is a versatile data structure that can model complex relationships. It is extensively used in various domains to solve real-world problems.
