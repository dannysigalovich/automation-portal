# Csharp

**C# Code Style Guide and Method for "Automation Team".**

#**Introduction**
This guide lays out the coding standards for the automation team, focusing on readability, maintainability, and consistency. Following these guidelines ensures that the code is clean and easy to understand for all team members.

**1. Naming Conventions:**
* Classes and Methods: Use PascalCase and descriptive names.

```cpp
public class GoodUser
{
    public void CreateUser(string name)
    {
        // Write anything you want here :) - codE!
    }
}
```

* Variables and Parameters: Use camelCase!
`int userCount = 10;`

* Constants: Use ALL_CAPSLOCK_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
`const int MAX_USERS = 100;`

* Methods should use PascalCase

* Private methods should start with an underscore and use camelCase.
* Fields should start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase:

```cpp
private int anyField;
private string automationField;
```

* Properties should be written in PascalCase:

```cpp
public int MyProperty { get; set; }
public string AnotherProperty { get; private set; }
```

---
**2.Indentation and Spacing:**
 * Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs.

 * Use spaces around operators and after commas

`int result = a + b;`

---

**3. Bracing Style:**

```cpp
if (condition)
{
    // ×“ some code
}
else
{
    // some code
}
```
---
**4. Comments**
* Use single-line comments for brief explanations.
`// A single-line comment!`

* Use XML comments for method, class, and property documentation.


```cpp
/// <summary>
/// This method does something.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="parameter">Description of the parameter.</param>
public void MyMethod(string parameter)
{
    // Code here
}
```
---
**5.Error Handling**
* Use exception handling instead of returning error codes or other bad things.

```cpp
try
{
    // Code here
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```
---
**6.Code Organization**

* Organize the code with namespaces, classes, and methods.

* Place using outside the namespace.

```cpp
using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
    // Code here
}
```
---
**7.Method Design**
* Method Length: Keep methods short and focused on a single responsibility!!!

```cpp
public void ProcessDriver(Driver driver)
{
    InitDriver(driver);
    DriverMagic(driver);
    CloseDriver(driver);
}
```

* Method Parameters: Avoid using more than 3-4 parameters. Use a class or struct if more data is required!


```cpp
public class DriverDetails
{
    public int DriverId { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    // more propertiers
}

public void CreateDriver(DriverDetails details)
{
    // Code here .....
}
```
---
**8.Resource Management**
* Use 'using' Statements for Resource Management: This ensures that resources like file streams, database connections,anmd more  are properly closed or disposed of.

```cpp
using (var streamReader = new StreamReader("file.txt"))
{
    // Code here....
}
```
---

**9. Null Handling**
* Use Null-Conditional Operators: Use ?. and ?? to handle potential null values.
`string name = customer?.Name ?? "Unknown";`

---

**10. Avoid Magic Numbers **
* Use Constants or Enumerations: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enumerations for clarity.

```cpp
const int MinimumAge = 18;

if (user.Age < MinimumAge)
{
    // Code here...
}
```


---

**11. Logging and Monitoring**

* Implement Logging: Use logging frameworks for proper tracking and debugging
```cpp
_logger.LogInformation("Driver created with ID {DriverId}", driverId);
```
